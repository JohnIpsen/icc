          Our philosophy is simple: survive. Please enjoy reading the following
          guidelines to explain our breeding decisions and selection emphases
          which have lead to a strong survival for the past 40 years of raising
          registered cattle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cattle performance depends on a combination of genetics and
          environment; therefore, the constant in which we endure is obviously
          not the environment. Through this equation, genetics must be able to
          react, adapt and optimize during favorable weather while being able to
          endure, maintain and even reproduce during the unfavorable weather
          seasons. From this simple approach, we have dubbed our trait
          selections as “convenience traits”. We strive for these traits with no
          single trait being soley sought after, but the whole package being
          desired. Since different genetics bring different packages, mating
          decisions carry trait emphasis, but the entire herd is aimed at cattle
          which are easy to maintain, resulting in our goal to produce cattle --
          “convenience for cattlemen!”
        </p>
        <h2>Convenience Traits</h2>
        <h3>Maternal:</h3>
        <p>
          New calves cannot sustain life without a great start. We cannot expect
          a sprint runner to win a race after a bad start, so why would be
          expect cattle to perform after a year of age? When calves are born,
          the cows are expected to have ample milk with a high level of
          colostrum and be able to protect those calves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Predation is a very uncommon occurrence, but it does happen and these
          cows need to be ready. Obviously maternal characteristics are derived
          around a solid udder. We are very critical of udder structure. We feel
          that problems in udder structure helped lead to the detriment of the
          Hereford breed's decline from a few decades ago, and we want our
          customers to know we put strong selection pressure on udder quality.
          This selection pressure, from the early days of Ipsen Herefords, has
          resulted in a consistent 96% weaning rate.
        </p>
        <h3>Reproduction:</h3>
        <p>
          With input costs at record highs, it is impractical to be patient with
          cattle that do not excel until later in life. From this, we strive to
          have cows that breed easy, regardless of condition and weather. Our AI
          program is quick, simple and easy. The cows are synchronized during
          November with the basic CIDR protocol, AI’d 12 hours after first
          observed standing heat, and turned in with a cleanup bull two weeks
          later. Cows are not given a second chance to be AI’d. When
          replacements are selected, AI-sired calves are given a first chance.
          This selection process over the past two decades has lead to a very
          fertile cowherd resulting in a consistent 75-80% conception rate from
          AI.
        </p>
        <h3>Performance:</h3>
        <p>
          Performance pressure in our cattle has increased in the last few
          years. Before Ipsen Cattle Company became a strictly fall-calving
          operation in 2005, performance was maintained at a strong level with
          average weaning weights ranging from 650-750 lbs. when weaned in the
          fall. The cattle composition and cyclical season provided a strong
          relationship. Grass came when calves were at peak performance levels
          and cows were at high energy need levels. Fall feed came as calves
          were optimizing growth and becoming self-dependent. ADG levels reach
          astonishing levels at this time. However, labor demands became
          overwhelming with the situation at hand, and ICC moved to fall
          calving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we fight the seasonal cycle with calves hitting the ground in
          green grass. But, by the time these calves can utilize feed for
          performance, lignin levels are high and protein levels are down.
          Manufactured hay feeding is the result. This has also increased our
          farming pressure to produce more hay for the same amount of cows.
          Calves must fight the winter cold and still gain weight. Cows must
          maintain and reproduce from low-energy feeds. Though our weaning
          weights have come down slightly from the added environmental pressure,
          our yearling weights have been able to maintain, and in fact, have
          grown in our replacement heifers! These cattle now have more pressure
          on themselves to perform than ever before at ICC. These cattle must
          utilize a very high percentage of feed to satisfy energy gain
          requirements. We strongly feel this will convert to added bottom line
          dollars for our customers.
        </p>
        <h3>Phenotype:</h3>
        <p>
          This is a broad convenience trait, but still very important. What we
          describe as "phenotype" is correct structure. Our cows run in valley
          pastures, foothills and high mountain ranges. Their feet must be able
          to maintain in all these conditions. If they can’t, we don’t keep
          them. Adequate muscling is included in phenotype. We breed for a
          slightly moderate herd; most of our cows will reach around a 6.0
          frame. These cattle must be stout, gain pounds easily and maintain
          their structure at all times. They must have capacity. Without this,
          the winter selection process will cull these types of cattle. The
          capacity to eat feed each day from a one-time feeding, and keep this
          feed 24 hrs until the next feeding. The cows must be able to supply
          themselves, the calf at side and the calf inside. Our phenotype, we
          feel, is what truly sells our cattle. If we don’t enjoy looking at
          them, we don’t expect our customers to either.
        </p>
        <p>
          These traits have been the driving factors of our cowherd since it
          began to build in the late 1960s. When our cowherd became a truly
          registered seedstock providing herd, we knew these traits would lead
          to ensured success. A few of the pedigrees in our Hereford cows are
          older names, but we feel these are the type of cattle that met and
          exceeded our demands for convenience traits. If they performed well,
          they stayed; If they didn’t, they left. Our cowherd is driven by the
          pressure. We love to take people through our cows just to see their
          satisfied reaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the mid 1990s, Mark Ipsen decided to introduce the Angus breed to
          the operation and change Ipsen Herefords to Ipsen Cattle Company. The
          theory behind this was obvious -- We had too many customers asking for
          Angus cattle to match our Herefords and we wanted to maintain the
          market share that the Ipsen name had built. We also feel the best
          hybrid is the English cross, white face cattle. The black baldy is by
          far the best type of cross for all the convenience traits mentioned
          here. They are the most popular for a commercial cowherd, and are even
          more sought after for recipient cows in registered programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          At ICC, we are continuously striving to produce cattle that will work
          for any ranching operation in any geographic location. From pasture to
          plate, we have always been dedicated to producing quality beef.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          From performance testing at various locations in the Intermountain
          West, to utilizing innovative production practices like artificial
          insemination and embryo transfer, our cowherd has been extremely
          productive and efficient and our bulls have been proven to work for a
          wide variety of cattlemen.
